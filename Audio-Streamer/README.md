### Audio Streaming
The audio streaming folder consists of all files needed in order to run the code to allow the streaming of audio via the device's microphone directly to an output device that is connected via Bluetooth. The user will be able to set the phone or device running the application anywhere they would like to hear live audio from and have that audio be live streamed directly into the output device. This portion of the code was made using Java for the backend and Kotlin using Jetpack Compose for the front end user interface.
#### Note that there is unused and commented out code within the streaming audio code from the audio playback code (specifically any code that is titled audio player or has mention of audio player). This is there in hopes that future groups will be able to combine the two projects into one
