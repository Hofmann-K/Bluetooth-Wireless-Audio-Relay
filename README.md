# 2023-2024 TCNJ Senior Project: Bluetooth-Wireless-Audio-Relay
### Kevin Hofmann, Dennis Donnelly, Michael DeGeorge, and Jack McGinley

## Our Mission
Our mission is to create a wireless bluetooth audio relay that will allow users to record some source of audio on a microphone and be able to wirelessly transmit that file to our app on an andriod device that will allow the user to playback their audio recording as well as upload it to the cloud.
