### Audio Playback
The audio playback folder consists of all files needed in order to run the code to allow the recording of audio via the device's microphone. The user will then be able to playback the audio recorded during that time from start to finish until a new audio recording is recorded and stopped overriding the old recording. This portion of the code was made using Java for the backend and Kotlin using Jetpack Compose for the front end user interface.
