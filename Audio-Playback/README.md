# 2023-2024 TCNJ Senior Project: Bluetooth-Wireless-Audio-Relay
### Kevin Hofmann, Dennis Donnelly, Michael DeGeorge, and Jack McGinley

## Our Mission
Our mission is to create a wireless bluetooth audio relay that will allow users to record some source of audio on a microphone and be able to wirelessly stream that file to our app on an andriod device that will allow the user to playback their audio recording.
